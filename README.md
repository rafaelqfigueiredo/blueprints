# Blueprints
Introduce _blueprints_ (_aka_ decision records), a way to formalize and document important architectural decisions within the team.

_Blueprints_ provides a structured approach to capture, communicate and enforce architectural decisions, enabling developers to understand the rationale behind each decision, and define an architectural roadmap for our codebase.
