<!--
  To get started with a blueprint you can use this template.

  You are not constrained by the content in this template. If you have a good idea about what
  should be in your blueprint, you can ignore the template, but if you don't know yet what should
  be in it, this template might be handy.

  Just because a blueprint is merged does not mean it is complete or approved.
  Any blueprint is a working document and subject to change at any time.

  If there are new details that belong in the blueprint, edit the blueprint. Once a blueprint
  has become "implemented", major changes should get new blueprints.
